# Last minutes of the presentation for Activity 5

There were conducted manual and automated testing techniques. Manual testing was used to test Functions and automated testing was used to test Classes and Methods inside them.

The main goal of the testing procedures was to report, resolve and retest MusoPlan software components until they reach the quality standards defined by the client.

The test plan should be created in the early stages of the projects; it is much easier to detect hidden errors/defects/bugs in the code. Conducting a testing phase after the completion of the project is no good practice. For example, if the main function has a defect it means the developer has to spend so much time to fix the error and the cost of resolving these bugs will be so much higher when compared to the earlier stages. Thus, each created function/class/method should be tested after development. It will minimise the overall development and maintenance costs of the project.
