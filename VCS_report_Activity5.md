##**Difficulties or challenges during development**
There weren’t any difficulties to use VCS (GitHub). It only took a few minutes to set up a repository. If I want to share my project with the educator/team, then I clone it and put it on the server. The project is small and easier to manage, so if you make mistakes it’s easier to rectify.

The most challenging thing is that one-day code is working and the next day it doesn’t execute properly. Another one is that you always have to remember to add and commit messages about new functions.

 ##**How you complied with the organisational requirements**
GitHub’s interface is user-friendly and one of the most known VCSs among developers to work with. Anyone can sign up and host a public code repository for free, which makes GitHub an open-source project.
I use Github to manage and develop my own small projects.
GitHub gives the opportunity to safely work through branching and merging.
With branching, you can duplicate part of the source code (called the repository). You can then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project.
Then, once you get your part of the code working properly, you can merge that code back into the main source code to make it official.
The project starts with a README.md file where the user can find information on how to use the software that was created. 
All the commit messages are clear and meet the industry requirements.


##**How you verified the VCS was performing as expected, behaviours you should test and describe include**
I was able to view the branches that were being worked on, as well as when I made a commit. I was able to create my own branch and make my own commits there.
During the implementation, I was able to add and commit new files and functions that I created. I used two branches, one for required documents and another one for the code. After making final changes in my branches, I merged them with the main branch. I used to push (git push origin) to send all the changes in my repository. 
Once I created and finished my report, I could fork my educator’s repository and submit that document back to a branch by making a pull request. A pull request is basically asking the person in charge of the branch to include your code/document. And it also helps that person see exactly what you’ve changed in the code/document.

##**If your repository was forked from another repository, how would you go about having them integrate your changes to the central repository?**
After making all the changes in the branch and merging that branch with the main, I would send a pull request with the detailed message with the proposed changes.
